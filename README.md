# GLOOMHAVEN Companion (WIP)

Little companion to manage gloomhaven turn order in a simple manner.

**Why not using an existing app?**

You can use them of course, but this app is designed to lay down on the game board.  



## :link: Access Site

This app is currently not deployed, but will be available at companion.gloomhaven.tomschinelli.io

**Note:** To save money, the app must be deployed manually and will be 
destroyed every evening at 24:00 UTC. Since it is mainly for my own group, it will only be deployed, when we're playing

If there is enough interest in this app, me


## :bulb: Ideas for the future

All features depend on my personal need or if there is enough interest in this app. 

So all features mentioned below are currently just ideas:

### Modular design
Each feature can be displayed on its own device. 

This way, you can opt in features for your personal need. 

**Pitfalls:** 

This feature requires a backend that currently doesn't exist. 

All devices have to communicate with each other. If the deployed version is used by 
multiple groups, this must be considered in the backend.

Furthermore, users must log into the app.

This escalates quickly into much work.
